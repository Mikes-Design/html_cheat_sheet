    <!--<head> element-->
        <p> The head HTML element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets. There can be only
             one head element in an HTML document. <strong>Note:</strong> head primarily holds informaiton for machine processing, not human-readability.
            For human-visable information, like top-level headings and listed authors, see the header element</p>
    
    </section>

    <section>
        <!--<header> element-->
        
        <h2>Header Element</h2>
        
        <p>The header HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some
            heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.
        </p>

        <h2>Usage notes</h2>

        <p>When not nested within sectioning content, main, or an element with the same ARIA role as these elements' implicit ARIA role, then the header element has an
            indentical meaning to the sire-wide banner landmark role. It defines a global site header, which usually includes a logo, company name, search feature,
            and possibly the global navigation or a slogan. It is generally located at the top of the page.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>Otherwise, when nested within said elemnts, it loses its landmark status and represents a group of introductory or navigational aids for the surronding section.
            It usually contains the surronding section's heading (an h1 - h6 element) and optional subheading, but this is not required.
        </p>

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>

        <p>The header element defines a banner landmark when its context is the body element.</p>

        <br>

        <p>When places inside an article, main, section, nav, aside, or an element with the same ARIA role as these elements' implicit ARIA role, the header element has the

        generic role instead, and is no longer considered a landmark. In this case, it cannot be labeled with aria-label or aria-labelby
        </p>

        <p>With HTML you can create the look of the form but not the functionailty to make it function you will need to uses php or another language</p>

        <form action="process.php" method="POST">
            <div> 
                <label>First Name</label>
                <input type="text" name="first_name" placeholder="Enter first name">

            <div>
                <label>Email</label>
                <input type="email" name="email">

            <div>
                <label>Message</label>
                <textarea name="message"></textarea>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                <label>Gender</label>
                <select name="gender"></select>
                <option value="male"></option>
                <option valee="female"></option>
                <option value="other"></option>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                <label>Age:</label>
                <input type="number" name="age" value ="32">
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                <label>Birthday:</label>
                <input type="date" name="birthday">
            </div>
            <br>
            <input type="submit" name="submit" value="submit">
        </form>

        <p> action submits a form to a certain mage example process.php and that maybe be a register form method is ususally a POST for a form which is 
            making a post request to a server which is used to do stuff like add data to a database opped to GET which is going to submit it and 
            the data is filled in the URL which is fine for search</p>
            
            <br>

            <p>the input tag is going to have a attribute called type for example text input the name has to do with server side programming
                for example in a php file the name value is what we would use to grab the input or value of the form</p><br>

                <p>Lables and inputs are both inline which means they will appear in the same line usually you will have form fields on sepperate lines
                    to fix this you can add divs which is a blcok level element
                </p>
                
                <br>

                <p>For email you can use text input be with HTML5 we can use email input which will add a little validaiton without using javascript if you try to submit
                    form and it is not valid it will show an error with email input </p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <p>for message you can leave a text area which is like a bigger text input </p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <p>for select options use select list for example to choose gender the option tag adds options based on what value and text is inputed</p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <p>For number type we are putting age with a type of number and we can also add a predetermined value the number type has arrows to change the number on the form</p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <p>The date type is a date selector</p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <p>placeholder for example in our first form allows you to put greyed out text that can be replaced when the input is being typed</p>
                    
                    <br>

                    <p>input type submit adds a button to submit the form the value is the text that is shown on the button
                        it will get procesed by process.php because that is what we put in the action of the form
                    </p>
                    
                    <br>

    <section>

    <!--Button-->
     <hr> <!--<hr> adds a line-->  
    <button>click me</button>

        <p>the button tag isnt going to do anything because in order to make it do somthing is to add some javascript</p>

    <!--Image-->
    <a href="images/sample.jpg">              
    <img src=" " alt="my simple image" width="200">
    </a>
    <P>to make the image show it needs to be in the same directory unless you specifify which folder it in in example "images/sample1.jpg"</P>
    
    <br>

    <p>images should use an alt attribute which displays whatever text alt is = to </p>
    
    <br>

    <p>there is also a width and height attribute in HTML but CSS is requimended note: images are also inline and by defualt the hieght is set to auto</p>
    
    <br>

    <p>If wanted you can wrap a link around a image and you can point to the acually location of the image which would open up in the browser when clicked</p>

    </section>

    <section>

    <!--Quotations-->

    <blockqoute
        cite="example.com">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
    </blockqoute>

    <p>blockqoute takes an attribute called site which is where the qoute comes from its not going to show the actual site unless you look at the source code</p>

    <section>
    <!--abbreaviation tag-->

    <p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>is awesome</p>
